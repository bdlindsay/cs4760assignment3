Compile and run program with:
	make
	master

	Optional argument to add an int as an argument (master [int]). The number given will change the timeout duration (in seconds) of the program from its default value (60 sec). Master.h implements a struct to hold the shared variables between processes. For clean-up when the timeout is reached, a system command, "killall slave", ensures all slave processes are cleaned up after signaling each process to end. Appropriate messages for SIGINTs received, timeout, and critical_section operations are displayed in stderr as specified in the assignment documentation.

	make clean will clean up additional files created from compilation. The designated write-to file, cstest, is not cleaned up and is appended to upon each run of master as the results file is requested for turn-in. Remove or empty the file to have a clean slate.

	GitHub was used for version control. 1 day of changes was committed on a later day on accident. 'git log' should show the change log and all the work was done on this directory so /.git should contain all logs this time.

On compilation, a warning occurs for extern variables. See this link for details on this: https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=45977. The way extern was used in the project follows example code we were supposed to use.
